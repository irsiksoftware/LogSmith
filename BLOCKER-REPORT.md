# Critical Environment Blocker Report

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Reported By:** Claude IC Engineer
**Status:** BLOCKED

## Problem Summary

All Bash tool commands are failing with the error:
```
Command failed: cygpath -u 'C:\Users\Ender\AppData\Local\Temp'
```

This error occurs before any command execution, indicating a fundamental issue with the Git Bash/Cygwin environment's path conversion utility.

## Impact

- **Cannot execute `gh` CLI commands** to query GitHub issues for labels ("in-progress", "ready", "blocked")
- **Cannot run git commands** to check branches or repository state
- **Cannot execute PowerShell scripts** via bash wrapper
- **Cannot run build/test scripts** (run-build.ps1, run-tests.ps1)
- **Cannot execute send_issue_email.py** to notify stakeholders

This blocks the entire IC engineer workflow as described in the instructions:
1. Cannot triage PRs
2. Cannot identify next work items by label
3. Cannot run tests locally
4. Cannot create/merge PRs (git operations fail)
5. Cannot send completion notifications

## Attempted Workarounds

1. ✗ Direct `gh` commands via bash
2. ✗ PowerShell wrapper via bash
3. ✗ Python scripts via bash
4. ✗ CMD wrapper via bash
5. ✗ Batch files via bash
6. ✗ Setting TMPDIR environment variable
7. ✗ All attempts failed with same cygpath error

## Current State Assessment

Based on README analysis, I determined:
- **Completed Issues:** #1, #6, #7, #44 (marked in README)
- **Next Priority:** #9 (Unity logging bootstrapper) per Phase 2

Manual file inspection reveals:
- `UnityLoggingBootstrap.cs` exists with full implementation
- `UnityLoggingBootstrapTests.cs` exists with 23 comprehensive tests
- Issue #9 appears COMPLETED but **status unknown in GitHub** (cannot verify labels)

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Fix Environment (Preferred)
1. Diagnose cygpath failure - may be Windows path or environment variable issue
2. Reinstall Git Bash or repair Cygwin paths
3. Verify TEMP/TMP environment variables are properly set

### Option 2: Alternative Tool Usage
1. Use native Windows PowerShell (not via Git Bash wrapper)
2. Execute gh/git commands directly from PowerShell
3. Bypass Bash tool entirely for this session

### Option 3: Manual Label Management
1. User manually checks GitHub issue labels via web UI
2. User provides issue numbers with "in-progress" or "ready" labels
3. IC engineer proceeds with known issue numbers

## Next Steps if Unblocked

Once GitHub access is restored:
1. Query issues with labels: `gh issue list --label in-progress --label ready`
2. Identify highest priority in-progress issue, or select next ready issue
3. Run tests: `./run-tests.ps1 -IssueNumber <NUM>`
4. Verify 100% coverage requirement
5. Create PR if new work, or merge if PR exists and tests pass

## Request for Decision

**DECISION NEEDED:** Which option should be pursued to unblock this session?

- [ ] Option 1: Troubleshoot cygpath/environment issue
- [ ] Option 2: Provide PowerShell-based alternative commands
- [ ] Option 3: Manually provide issue numbers to work on
